It supports limited forms of multithreading, induced by initial partitioning schemes.\n\nArguments\n\nsat: The metric data structure.\nipart: initial partitioning scheme for the tree. It supports the following kinds of objects:\nSatInitialPartition(): Traditional construction, default value. Each part is a SAT partition and will be processed by a thread on multithreading setups.\nRandomInitialPartition(nparts=Threads.nthreads(), shuffle=false):   construction that divides the dataset (randomly if suffle=true) in nparts disjoint parts. The resulting structure violates the SAT partitioning in a whole   and creates a kind of SAT forest that are fine SAT partitions. Useful to limit the height of the tree and for multiprocessing purporses, i.e., each part will be processed by a thread.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nsortsat: The strategy to create the spatial access tree, it heavily depends on the order of elements while it is build. It accepts:\nRandomSortSat(): children are randomized.\nProximalSortSat(): classical approach, near elements are put first.\nDistalSortSat(): recent approach, distant elements are put first.\nminleaf: Minimum number of children to perform a spatial access separation (half space partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#SAT-orders","page":"API","title":"SAT orders","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"API","title":"API","text":"ProximalSortSat\nDistalSortSat\nRandomSortSat","category":"page"},{"location":"#Approximate-similarity-search","page":"API","title":"Approximate similarity search","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"API","title":"API","text":"PruningSat\nBeamSearchSat\nBeamSearchMultiSat\n\noptimize!","category":"page"},{"location":"#SpatialAccessTrees.PruningSat","page":"API","title":"SpatialAccessTrees.PruningSat","text":"PruningSat(sat::Sat; factor=0.9)\n\nCreates an approximate similarity sarch index based on sat and aggressive pruning; adapted from the paper A probabilistic spell for the curse of dimensionality (Chavez and Navarro, 2001).
